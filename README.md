# Pomodoro_Timer_app
It is an app called pomodoro where I created the timer using HTML,CSS and Javascript
The Timer App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their time effectively. It supports multiple timer modes, including Pomodoro Mode (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes). Users can start, pause, reset, and stop the timer, and the app provides an audio alert when the timer reaches zero. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Key Features
Timer Functionality:
Start: Begins the countdown from the selected time.
Pause: Temporarily stops the timer without resetting it.
Reset: Resets the timer to the initial time of the selected mode.
Stop: Stops the timer completely and sets the time to 0:00.
Multiple Timer Modes:
Pomodoro Mode (25 minutes): Ideal for focused work sessions.
Short Break (5 minutes): Perfect for quick breaks.
Long Break (15 minutes): Great for longer relaxation periods.

Audio Alert:
Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero, notifying the user that the session is complete.

User-Friendly Interface:
Clean and intuitive design with clear buttons and a large timer display.Buttons have hover effects for better interactivity.

Responsive Design:
The app adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

How It Works
HTML Structure: The app is structured using semantic HTML elements like <div>, <button>, and <audio>.The timer display is a <span> element that dynamically updates as the timer counts down.

CSS Styling:The app uses CSS for styling, including flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.Buttons have distinct colors for different modes (green for Pomodoro, yellow for Short Break, and red for Long Break).

JavaScript Logic:The timer functionality is implemented using setInterval and clearInterval to manage the countdown.Event listeners are added to buttons to handle user interactions (start, pause, reset, stop, and mode switching).The timer updates every second, and the display is formatted to show minutes and seconds (e.g., 25:00).

Audio Alert: An <audio> element is used to play a sound when the timer reaches zero. The sound file (alert.mp3) is triggered using JavaScript.

Code Structure
HTML: Defines the structure of the app, including the timer display, control buttons, and mode buttons.

Links to the CSS file (styles.css) and JavaScript file (script.js).

CSS: Styles the app with a clean and modern design. Ensures responsiveness using media queries and flexible layouts.

JavaScript: Handles the core functionality of the app, including: Starting, pausing, resetting, and stopping the timer. Switching between timer modes. Updating the timer display dynamically.

Playing an audio alert when the timer ends.
